# EDA on Gene Expression üß¨üíª

This project explores different gene expression datasets for different medical cases using python. You get the opportunity to put your skills into practice and possibly learn new ones.
These are to serve as examples of real-life use cases and exclusively for **educational purposes**.

## GSE2034
With the GSE2034 breast cancer dataset, it performs basic exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns in gene expression levels across samples.

### Dataset
- Source: [GEO - GSE2034](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE2034)
- insight: `data/raw/GSE2034.md` walks you through the download process of GSE2034

### Goals
- Visualize expression distributions
- Check for missing or noisy data
- Perform PCA and correlation analysis

### How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Download `GSE2034.csv` into `data/raw/`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open Jupyter: `jupyter lab`
